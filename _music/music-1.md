**Prelude and Fugue in C major (2021)**\
_for piano, 3'52"_\

I've always loved counterpoint and jazz. After the subject and answer of this fugue came to me as I was doing the laundry one day, I knew I wanted to try combining the two somehow.

This piece was featured in the [fifth issue](https://aacc.yalecollege.yale.edu/resources/295-magazine) of _295 Magazine_, published by the Asian American Cultural Center at Yale.

The fugue is also playable for saxophone quartet, string quartet, or similar ensemble; feel free to email me for parts or arrangement requests.

**Two Sides of the Same Canon (2021)**\
_for two clarinets, 3'35"_\

This piece consists of two mirror canons—really one mirror canon that is itself inverted to create a second movement—built around a familiar theme that originated in October 2020. Bonus points if you can guess it...

The instrumentation is flexible; feel free to email me for arrangement requests.
