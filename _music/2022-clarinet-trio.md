I began writing this four-movement trio during my gap year after high school, and I completed it during my first year of college. Its structure and stylistic eclecticism mirror my growth and transitions into new phases of life.

In spring 2022, this piece was featured alongside my [prelude and fugue](https://luc-ta.github.io/music/2021-contrapuntal-pieces/) in the [fifth issue](https://aacc.yalecollege.yale.edu/resources/295-magazine) of _295 Magazine_, published by the Asian American Cultural Center at Yale. That August, it was also showcased on YouTube creator [TheExarion](https://www.youtube.com/@TheExarion)'s livestream.

The clarinet may be substituted by a violin, viola, or alto saxophone; feel free to email me for parts or arrangement requests.
