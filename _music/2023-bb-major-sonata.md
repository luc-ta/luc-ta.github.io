I wrote this four-movement sonata partially as a serious, extended exercise in writing for brass instruments—a fun and mostly new experience for me as someone who specialized in the clarinet and saxophone families in high school.

This piece was featured in the [sixth issue](https://aacc.yalecollege.yale.edu/resources/295-magazine) of _295 Magazine_, published by the Asian American Cultural Center at Yale.

The trombone may be substituted by a bassoon, bass clarinet, or cello; feel free to email me for parts or arrangement requests.
