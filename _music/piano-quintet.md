_for two violins, viola, cello, and piano, 18'36"_\
[![Luc Ta - Piano Quintet (2023)](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Hk-ibIDhY2s/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hk-ibIDhY2s&list=PLYZn6AEJG5Oc9pHJ__hMAyvc0bUI8K-Ql&index=1)\
This two-movement quintet was partially inspired by "Feldschlacht V" and "Die Wahrheit" by Masashi Hamauzu, two contrasting miniatures for piano quintet. Thinking about these pieces as a sort of diptych, I wanted to elaborate further upon the structural and stylistic blueprints they lay out.

This piece was featured in the [seventh issue](https://aacc.yalecollege.yale.edu/resources/295-magazine) of _295 Magazine_, published by the Asian American Cultural Center at Yale.
