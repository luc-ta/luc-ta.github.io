I am a senior at Yale University studying mathematics on the intensive track and ethnic studies. Starting this fall, I'll be a Ph.D. student in mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh, supported by the K. Leroy Irvis Fellowship. I plan to become a mathematics professor in the future.

I'm particularly interested in algebra, category theory, geometry, topology, and the intersections of these areas. For further information about my research, please refer to my [CV](https://luc-ta.github.io/cv/).

I also love teaching mathematics and have served for three years as a teaching assistant in Yale's math department. Accessibility, equity, and inclusivity form the center of my teaching ethos; I aim to foster welcoming and safe environments for mathematical exploration as a creative, communal, and human endeavor. Coupled with my research interests, the transformative power of mathematics in the hands of marginalized communities like my own forms a central part of my professional motivations.

Outside of mathematics (arguably), I am a self-taught [composer](https://luc-ta.github.io/music/) specializing in contemporary chamber music. I am always on the lookout for performance opportunities and am more than happy to supply parts or arrangements to interested musicians for a small price; please reach out via email at luc (dot) ta (at) yale (dot) edu.
