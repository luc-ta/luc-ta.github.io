I am a rising senior at Yale University studying mathematics on the intensive track and ethnic studies. I plan to become a mathematics professor in the future. Currently, my primary research interests lie in algebraic geometry, Lie theory, and geometric group theory. I am also interested in these fields' applications in geometric topology and smooth knot theory.

Through the 2024 REU at Moravian University, I conducted two knot-theoretic research projects under the supervision of Samantha Pezzimenti and Wing Hong Tony Wong; I presented our work on toric knot mosaics at the [UnKnot V](https://sites.google.com/view/unknot-v-conference/home?authuser=0) conference in July. In the spring, I also plan to write and defend a bachelor's thesis in algebraic geometry under the supervision of Sam Raskin. For further information, please refer to my [CV](https://luc-ta.github.io/cv/).

I also love teaching mathematics; this year will mark my third year as a teaching assistant in Yale's math department. Accessibility, equity, and inclusivity form the center of my teaching ethos; I aim to foster welcoming and safe environments for mathematical exploration as a creative, communal, and human endeavor. Coupled with my research interests, the transformative power of mathematics in the hands of marginalized communities like my own forms a central part of my professional motivations.

Outside of mathematics (arguably), I am a self-taught [composer](https://luc-ta.github.io/music/) specializing in contemporary chamber music. I am always on the lookout for performance opportunities and am more than happy to supply parts or arrangements to interested musicians; please reach out via email.
