I'm a mathematics PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh. Broadly speaking, I'm interested in the relationships between algebra, category theory, geometry, and topology. I'm a proud first-generation college graduate, and my goal is to become a mathematics professor in the future. This year, I'm supported by the K. Leroy Irvis Fellowship.

Before coming to Pitt, I double majored in mathematics on the intensive track and ethnic studies at Yale. My researched focused on group-theoretic and categorical aspects of racks and quandles, which are nonassociative algebraic structures used to construct invariants of knots. groups, and pointed Hopf algebras. For more information, please refer to my [CV](https://luc-ta.github.io/cv/).

I also love teaching mathematics and served for three years as a teaching assistant in Yale's math department. Accessibility, equity, and inclusivity form the center of my teaching ethos; I aim to foster welcoming and safe environments for mathematical exploration as a creative, communal, and human endeavor. Coupled with my research interests, the transformative power of mathematics in the hands of marginalized communities like my own forms a central part of my professional motivations.

Outside of mathematics, I'm a hobbyist [composer](https://luc-ta.github.io/music/) specializing in contemporary chamber music with a side interest in orchestral music for games. I'm more than happy to supply scores, parts, and arrangements to interested musicians for a small price; please reach out via email at luc (dot) ta (at) aya (dot) yale (dot) edu.
