I'm a mathematics PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh. My work is supported by the K. Leroy Irvis Fellowship, and I hope to become a mathematics professor in the future. I'm a proud first-generation college grad, and I double majored in mathematics on the intensive track and ethnic studies at Yale.

Broadly, I'm interested in algebra, category theory, geometry, topology, and how these all intersect. Before coming to Pitt, I studied certain varieties of nonassociative algebras called _racks_ and _quandles_ and combinatorial objects called _knot mosaics_ originating from knot theory. For more information, please refer to my [CV](https://luc-ta.github.io/cv/).

I also love teaching mathematics and served for three years as a teaching assistant in Yale's math department. Accessibility, equity, and inclusivity form the center of my teaching ethos; I aim to foster welcoming and safe environments for mathematical exploration as a creative, communal, and human endeavor. Coupled with my research interests, the transformative power of mathematics in the hands of marginalized communities like my own forms a central part of my professional motivations.

Outside of mathematics (arguably), I am a self-taught [composer](https://luc-ta.github.io/music/) specializing in contemporary chamber music. I am always on the lookout for performance opportunities and am more than happy to supply parts or arrangements to interested musicians for a small price; please reach out via email at luc (dot) ta (at) yale (dot) edu.
