I am a senior at Yale University studying mathematics on the intensive track and ethnic studies. I plan to become a mathematics professor in the future. Currently, I'm most interested in the intersections of algebra, category theory, geometry, and topology, especially smooth knot theory.

Through the 2024 REU at Moravian University, I conducted two knot-theoretic research projects under the supervision of Samantha Pezzimenti and Wing Hong Tony Wong (see one of our submitted preprints [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08064)). I am also writing a senior thesis under the supervision of Sam Raskin studying generalized Legendrian racks, which are a nonassociative algebraic structure recently introduced to distinguish between Legendrian knots. For further information about my research, please refer to my [CV](https://luc-ta.github.io/cv/).

I also love teaching mathematics; this year marks my third year as a teaching assistant in Yale's math department. Accessibility, equity, and inclusivity form the center of my teaching ethos; I aim to foster welcoming and safe environments for mathematical exploration as a creative, communal, and human endeavor. Coupled with my research interests, the transformative power of mathematics in the hands of marginalized communities like my own forms a central part of my professional motivations.

Outside of mathematics (arguably), I am a self-taught [composer](https://luc-ta.github.io/music/) specializing in contemporary chamber music. I am always on the lookout for performance opportunities and am more than happy to supply parts or arrangements to interested musicians for a small price; please reach out via email at luc (dot) ta (at) yale (dot) edu.
