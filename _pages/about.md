I am a rising senior at Yale University double majoring in mathematics on the intensive track and ethnic studies. I am preparing to apply to graduate school in mathematics with the ultimate goal of becoming a mathematics professor. At the moment, my primary research interests lie in algebraic geometry, Lie theory, geometric group theory, and their relationships with category theory. I am also interested in these fields' applications in (smooth) knot theory, graph theory, and voting theory and electoral redistricting.

Through the REU at Moravian University, I am currently working on two knot-theoretic research projects under the supervision of Samantha Pezzimenti and Tony W. H. Wong. I had the pleasure of presenting our work on toric knot mosaics at the [UnKnot V](https://sites.google.com/view/unknot-v-conference/home?authuser=0) conference in July. This fall, I will write and defend a bachelor's thesis in algebraic geometry under the supervision of Sam Raskin. For further information, please refer to my [CV](https://luc-ta.github.io/cv/).

I also love teaching mathematics and look forward to serving as an Undergraduate Learning Assistant (Yale's term for a TA) for abstract algebra this fall. Previously, I have served as a ULA for the yearlong pre/calculus and real analysis sequences. Accessibility, equity, and inclusivity form the center of my teaching ethos; I aim to foster welcoming and safe environments for mathematical exploration as a creative, communal, and human endeavor.

Along with my research and teaching interests, the transformative power of mathematics when put into the hands of marginalized communities forms a central part of my professional motivations. I strive toward a mathematical practice centered around solidarity, accessibility, and community; my experiences as a first-generation college student inform my advocacy work with organizations including the Yale math department's Student Advisory Council, oSTEM, and Delta Alpha Pi, an international honor society for students with disabilities.

Outside of mathematics (arguably), I am a self-taught [composer](https://luc-ta.github.io/music/) specializing in contemporary chamber music. I am always on the lookout for performance opportunities and am more than happy to supply parts or arrangements to interested musicians; please reach out via email.
