Hello! I am a rising senior at Yale University hoping to become a mathematics professor in the future.

Below is a list of my publications. To read more about me, please refer to my [CV](https://luc-ta.github.io/cv/) or my [bio](https://luc-ta.github.io/about/). Both of these are also accessible via the navigation bar located at the top of this webpage, along with a few of my [teaching](https://luc-ta.github.io/teaching/) resources and a catalog of my [music](https://luc-ta.github.io/music/).
