I am a rising senior at Yale University double majoring in mathematics on the intensive track and ethnic studies. I am preparing to apply to graduate school in mathematics with the intent of pursuing a career as a professor. My primary research interests lie in harnessing algebraic and category-theoretic tools to study geometric objects and vice versa, including but not limited to algebraic geometry, geometric group theory, and Lie theory. I also hold secondary research interests in knot theory, algebraic graph theory, and geometric approaches to voting theory and electoral redistricting.

Through the REU at Moravian University, I am currently working on two knot-theoretic reesarch projects under the supervision of Drs. Samantha Pezzimenti and Tony W. H. Wong. This fall, I plan to complete an undergraduate senior thesis in algebraic geometry under the supervision of Dr. Sam Raskin. I also love teaching and look forward to serving as a TA for abstract algebra this fall (and hopefully Galois theory in the spring). Previously, I have served as a TA for the yearlong pre/calculus and real analysis sequences.

Along with my interests in research and teaching, the transformative power of mathematics when put into the hands of marginalized groups forms a central part of my professional motivations. I strive toward a mathematical practice centered around solidarity, accessibility, and community; my experiences as a first-generation college student inform my advocacy work with the Yale math department's Student Advisory Council, the Just Mathematics Collective, oSTEM, and Delta Alpha Pi, an international honor society for students with disabilities.

Outside of mathematics, I compose chamber music in my free time. Score videos for my finished works are available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@LucTaMusic). I am more than happy to supply parts to anyone interested in performing my music; feel free to reach out via email.
