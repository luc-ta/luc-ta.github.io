Hello! I'm an incoming mathematics PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh supported by the K. Leroy Irvis Fellowship. I hope to become a mathematics professor in the future. I recently graduated from Yale, where I double majored in mathematics on the intensive track and ethnic studies. (You might know me as Luc Ta; that was my name prior to 2025.) 

Below is a list of my publications. To read more about me, please refer to my [CV](https://luc-ta.github.io/cv/) or my [bio](https://luc-ta.github.io/about/). Both of these are also accessible via the navigation bar located at the top of this webpage, along with a few of my [teaching](https://luc-ta.github.io/teaching/) resources and a catalog of my [music](https://luc-ta.github.io/music/).
