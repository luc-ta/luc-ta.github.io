I am a rising senior at Yale University double majoring in mathematics on the intensive track and ethnic studies. I am preparing to apply to graduate school in mathematics with the intent of pursuing a career as a professor. My primary research interests lie in harnessing algebraic and category-theoretic tools to study geometric objects and vice versa, including but not limited to algebraic geometry, geometric group theory, and Lie theory. I also hold secondary research interests in knot theory, algebraic graph theory, and geometric approaches to voting theory and electoral redistricting.

Through the REU at Moravian University, I am currently working on two knot-theoretic reesarch projects under the supervision of Drs. Samantha Pezzimenti and Tony W. H. Wong. This fall, I plan to complete an undergraduate senior thesis in algebraic geometry under the supervision of Dr. Sam Raskin. I also love [teaching](https://luc-ta.github.io/teaching/) and look forward to serving as a TA for abstract algebra this fall (and hopefully Galois theory in the spring). Previously, I have served as a TA for the yearlong pre/calculus and real analysis sequences.

Along with my research and teaching interests, the transformative power of mathematics when put into the hands of marginalized communities forms a central part of my professional motivations. I strive toward a mathematical practice centered around solidarity, accessibility, and community; my experiences as a first-generation college student inform my advocacy work with the Yale math department's Student Advisory Council; oSTEM; the Institute for the Quantitative Study of Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity; and Delta Alpha Pi, an international honor society for students with disabilities.

Outside of mathematics (arguably), I compose chamber music in my free time. Score videos for my finished works are available [here](https://luc-ta.github.io/music/). I am more than happy to supply parts to anyone interested in performing my music; please reach out via email.

Recent updates
======
July 2024: I will be delivering talks about my research on toric knot mosaics and Legendrian mosaic numbers at the UnKnot V conference at Seattle University.

May 2024: I have begun researching with Drs. Samantha Pezzimenti and Tony W.H. Wong through the REU at Moravian University.

April 2024: As a delegate with the Yale math department's Student Advisory Council, I helped organize a course scheduling and major planning workshop for students considering declaring a mathematics major, a professional development panel for prospective mathematics graduate school applicants, and a town hall to take feedback for the department, especially regarding its climate and inclusivity.
