I am a rising senior at Yale University double majoring in mathematics on the intensive track and ethnic studies. I am preparing to apply to graduate school in mathematics with the intent of pursuing a career as a professor. My primary research interests lie in harnessing algebraic and categorical tools to study geometric objects and manifolds and vice versa, including but not limited to algebraic geometry, Lie theory, and geometric group theory. I also hold secondary research interests in algebraic and (algebro-)geometric approaches to knot theory, graph theory, and voting theory and electoral redistricting.

Through the REU at Moravian University, I am currently working on two knot-theoretic reesarch projects under the supervision of Samantha Pezzimenti and Tony W. H. Wong; I will present our work at the UnKnot V conference at Seattle University in July. This fall, I look forward to writing and defending a bachelor's thesis in algebraic geometry under the supervision of Sam Raskin. For further information, please refer to my [CV](https://luc-ta.github.io/cv/).

I also love teaching mathematics and look forward to serving as an Undergraduate Learning Assistant (i.e., a TA) for abstract algebra this fall. Previously, I have served as a TA for the yearlong pre/calculus and real analysis sequences. Accessibility, equity, and inclusivity form the center of my teaching ethos; I aim to foster welcoming and safe environments for mathematical exploration as a creative, communal, and human endeavor.

Along with my research and teaching interests, the transformative power of mathematics when put into the hands of marginalized communities forms a central part of my professional motivations. I strive toward a mathematical practice centered around solidarity, accessibility, and community; my experiences as a first-generation college student inform my advocacy work with organizations including the Yale math department's Student Advisory Council, oSTEM, and Delta Alpha Pi, an international honor society for students with disabilities.

Outside of mathematics (arguably), I am a self-taught [composer](https://luc-ta.github.io/music/) specializing in contemporary chamber music. I am always on the lookout for performance opportunities and am more than happy to supply parts or arrangements to interested musicians; please reach out via email.

Recent updates
======
July 2024: I will be delivering talks about my research on toric knot mosaics and Legendrian mosaic numbers at the UnKnot V conference at Seattle University.

May 2024: I have begun researching with Drs. Samantha Pezzimenti and Tony W.H. Wong through the REU at Moravian University.

April 2024: As a delegate with the Yale math department's Student Advisory Council, I helped organize a course scheduling and major planning workshop for students considering declaring a mathematics major, a professional development panel for prospective mathematics graduate school applicants, and a town hall to take feedback for the department, especially regarding its climate and inclusivity.
