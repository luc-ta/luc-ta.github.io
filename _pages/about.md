I am a rising senior at Yale University double majoring in mathematics on the intensive track and ethnic studies. Under the supervision of Drs. Samantha Pezzimenti and Tony W. H. Wong, I am currently working on two projects through the REU at Moravian University. We are researching projections of mathematical knots onto the surfaces of tori and Klein bottles as well as the effects of stabilization on the mosaic numbers of Legendrian knots. This fall, I will complete an undergraduate thesis in algebraic geometry and/or Lie theory under the supervision of Dr. Sam Raskin. Previously, I have studied commutative algebra, graph theory, and modern combinatorics through the Polymath Jr. program and Budapest Semesters in Mathematics.

I am preparing to apply to graduate school in pure mathematics this winter with the intent of pursuing a career as a professor. At the moment, my primary research interests include algebraic geometry, Lie theory, and category theory. I hold secondary research interests in knot theory, geometric group theory, algebraic graph theory, and voting theory. I also love teaching and am excited to serve as a TA for abstract algebra this fall (and hopefully Galois theory in the spring). In previous semesters, I have served as a TA for precalculus, calculus, real analysis, and Lebesgue integration and Fourier analysis.

Along with mathematics research, the transformative and liberatory power of mathematics when put into the hands of marginalized groups forms a central part of my career motivations. My experiences as a first-generation college student inform my passion for fostering a mathematics community and practice centered around solidarity, accessibility, and collaboration over competition and individual detachment. These visions inform my advocacy work with the Yale math department's Student Advisory Council, the Just Mathematics Collective, oSTEM, and Delta Alpha Pi, an international honor society for students with disabilities.

In my free time, I also compose chamber music. Score videos for my finished works are available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@LucTaMusic). I am more than happy to supply parts to anyone interested in performing my music; feel free to reach out via email.
